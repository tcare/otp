<p>
The diameter application is an implementation of the Diameter protocol
as defined by RFC 3588.
It supports arbitrary Diameter applications by allowing a client to
specify the commands and AVP's to be supported and has support for
implementing all roles defined in the RFC: client, server and agent.
